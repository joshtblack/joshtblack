### Hello! 👋
I am Noodles, I mess around with projects here and there, although nothing much too significant. I prefer Javascript, though I do dabble my fingers in some other languages like Lua & Python.

---
The most you'll see me active is in the CFX Discord, I rarely talk anywhere else on Discord. I'm quite involved within the FiveM community, this is basically my home for my useless projects such as a website dedicated to calling someone a weeb, that kind of stuff, I basically never release for public use, so if you're here for that, you're not in the right place.

Otherwise, feel free to roam my projects!

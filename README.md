### Hello! ðŸ‘‹
I am Noodles, I mess around with projects here and there. I co-own a file/screenshot host named [Fileglass](https://file.glass) in which I manage infrastructure and develop frontend for.

---
I spend most of my time working on frontend projects, working with React frameworks such as Next.js and UI frameworks such as Tailwind CSS. The [file.glass](https://file.glass) website was built completely by me using Next.js, Preact and Tailwind CSS.

I have over 5 years of experience with [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com), approximately 3 years with [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) and approximately 2 years with [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/).
